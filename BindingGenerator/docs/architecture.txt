Generating Web Interface
	* Upload WSDL description
    * Axis converts WSDL to Java
	* Add persistence?
		* Set-up schedule now?
			* Choose API methods, choose date/time ranges/intervals, settings
	* Generates server instance locally, initiates
	* Generates client library instance

Server Instance
	* Daemon to take snapshots, stored in MySQL
	* Review snapshots
	* Pass along API calls, unless they should be using historical data

Client Library
	* Provides methods to interface with the API
	* Additional methods to "set time" (i.e. use historical data or use current data)

Storing Java stuff in a database:
    Here are some alternatives that you can use:
        The Java Object Serialization APIs as described in the links in @Nishant's answer.
        JSON serialization as described in @fatnjazzy's answer.
        An XML serialization library like XStream.
        An ORM mapping.
        
        
Conversation topics: 
    Do we want to use an RDBMS? NoSQL or Memcached seems like a better option for this.
    What Educational Theory are we relying on? How do we evalute the pedagogical impact?
        - Intrinsic Motivation related to using this app
    What are example projects that could take advantage of this?
        - Applications that use a real-time data feed that changes on a regular basis and doesn't provide historical data
            - This application provides cached versions of the data for testing purposes
    But can it be used for real-world purposes? Students shouldn't be able to rely on constantly cached data, right?
