Shower is good, beds are nice, the TV\'s are adequate but a little small, and the rate is comparable to the other 2 hotels close to campus.  The room layout is a little odd, but it slept 3 people comfortably, except for the AC.  The AC blew cold air but didn\'t seem large enough to cool both "rooms."  when the "sitting room" was cool the "bedroom" was a meat locker.  Then the sun came up and the bedroom got steamy and my friend on the couch bed caught hypothermia.\n\nI can live with the fluctuating temperatures, but the customer service here is more temperamental than the environmental controls.  I feel like there is a disconnect between what the owners think is happening and the real field situation.  We were told that the convertible sofa would be ummm.......converted......when we got there.   Nope, we had to set up the sofa bed and rob some pillows from the other bed.  There also wasn\'t much material to sleep under to combat the sub-zero conditions in the sitting room after dawn.  \n\nAlso,  when we checked in we were told that if the covered parking out back was full we could park in the garage across the street.  I found a spot out back and parked for the night.  We walked downtown to eat and returned to the hotel room to rest up for the bar crawl that was about to commence.  As soon as we get in the room the phone starts ringing.  It\'s the front desk asking us to move our vehicle to the garage.  My wife went to move the vehicle and spoke to the guy at the front desk who said that the covered spots were reserved.  What? Reserved for who?  There is plenty of reserved parking for check-ins and loading, and there is no sign on the covered parking that says anything about being reserved.  Did I not pay enough to park at the hotel?  \n\nThere were also a multitude of other minor annoyances that wouldn\'t fly at a Super 8, but appear to be OK for here.\n\nSo, the AC and customer service sucks, the location is nice and the price is right.  If I were to rank the 3 hotels close to campus, it would go: 1. The Inn at Virginia Tech, and tied for second would be this place and the Holiday Inn.', 'business_id': 'HaWJ-e4pm1XhF1qJyYOeeQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-06-06', 'type': 'review'}

The salsa that was brought out was fresh, with a slight bite, better than most in the area. So there was the good points... on to why I gave it 2 stars.

If you don\'t want a salty, sticky, and sugary mess you have the option to "have it your way" as the king would say.

When we arrived around 7:20 there was a sign on the door that said they would be closing at 8pm for a private party. We decided to pop in and see if they would still seat us and they were extremely accommodating. There was still a 25 minute wait though so we went into the bar side to have a drink. Although the bar is now smoke free it still reeks of previous smoke. However, we found a table and proceeded to order drinks. After waiting for a little while the hostess actually come into the bar and found us to tell us our table was ready.\n\nOur waitress was extremely helpful and friendly. I wish I could remember her name, but I'm drawing a blank at the moment. We ordered the charcuterie and daily cheese plate to start which were both delicious. The dish that I personally had was the Portobello Brie Sandwich with french fries. The bread that the sandwich came on was fabulous, I only wish that there was a little more brie to go with all the portobello!  The fries are actually seasoned fries which was a nice surprise as well. Other dishes that my party ordered were the Roast Pepper Alfredo, which I thought had a good flavor, but it seemed a little dry, and the 622 House Salad. The salad was beautiful, but the lime-cilantro dressing stole the show. It was amazing! We also got the Sausage Pizza for the table to try. I didn't personally have a slice, but there was so much gooey cheese that the others seemed to enjoy.\n\nThe patrons were definitely more of the local, Blacksburg type, not many students at all, which was nice. However, the bar side did seem to have more students/younger crowd. I've read some of the other reviews that said the restaurant seemed understaffed, but I honestly thought it was maybe slightly overstaffed because I kept looking up and feelings like we were being watched as we ate. But we were also there right before they were going to close and there was only one other table by the time we left.\n\nWould definitely go back as I'm dying to try the Risotto Cakes which I was deciding between when I ordered.", 'business_id': 'HAXTUHm3RFucIbNZSpIU3A', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-02-20', 'type': 'review'}

After we ordered, it was about another hour before the food came, albeit the server had to admit one order did not come out because he dropped the pizza on the floor...  I realize that this is a hangout joint, but really, do you have the time to "hangout" there for four-five hours on a Friday night?

This place was dark and dingy.  If that is "adult," I\'d rather go to any of the other many restaurants lining that same road.  \n\nThe food - wasn\'t much better than the ambience of the place.  I got the "Mad Greek."  I wonder if it would be better if it were the "Happy Greek."  The meat (all 3 thin slices) was extremely dry; the yogurt sauce was like tart mayonnaise water, and everything else was basically filler to make you feel like you got your money\'s worth.  Two surprising notes, which saved this place form the one star - the bread for the sandwich was good.

You get to pick swordfish, snapper, pork loin, ribeye, or whatever the menu has that day, and match it with any soup you want, some scallops or a salad, and have your choice of desert.

From the dining area you can also see into the beautiful mountain scenery and watch the sunset.\n\nMy coworker and I shared a bottle of Gehrwurtstresomething Riesling (the wine and beer menu is massive, with many local flavors), which got us pretty buzzed, and all the better because our company is paying for the entire trip!\n\nHowever, the best part was our waitress, Harmony. She was just "WOW."  Some servers just give your service, but Harmony was outstanding. This girl must really enjoy her job because I have never seen a waitress so friendly, funny and personable.

I was about half a glass shy from asking her if she wanted to come back to my hotel room when her shift was over.\n\nBottom line: come here, eat, be merry, and chat with Harmony.

We were seated at a booth right away. There was a duo playing Irish music for the occasion. I appreciated the fact that it was relatively quiet. The atmosphere was.. um... nice?

I think it would be a good place for a large group/family outing.\n\nWe ordered the Pashware naan as our appetizer, I got the Butter chicken, he got the Rashmi (sp?) Kabob, and the garlic naan. The appetizer took a little bit to come out, which I think was the only real downside to the evening. \n\nThe Pashware naan is naan stuffed with nuts and cherries, served with yogurt sauce. It reminded me of a quesadilla. Anyway, it was very delicious; not overbearing in flavor, but mildly sweet. I didn\'t really see the need for the yogurt thing though. \n\nThe food was served family style with a large plate of rice in the middle. The portions were plenty, and especially with the appetizer, we were stuffed without even finishing them. Oh, and the rice was really good. I usually don\'t comment on the rice because, well, it\'s just rice, but this was fragrant and well-cooked. Awesome!\n\nThey were both chicken dishes, and they were great!

It blends Japanese and Middle-eastern cousines into an interesting array of platters. The cooks are often experienced professionals. Being vegetarian, I have limited options almost anywhere, and this is no exception. However, the salads they have are truly tasty and far from the common. They serve stripes of ginger in almost every plate. And they have a few items I have not seen before. My family and I ended falling in love for their small, personal pizzas. They are, be warned, not your average type sold at chain stores. Instead, these pizzas are loaded with good stuff and lots of flavor (one of my favorites has lots of eggplant). The sushi, I hear, is good, but I cannot confirm that. The place is small, and can become crowded, not surprisingly, in the one street in Blacksburg that is often also congested (when the students are in). Eating here is perfect for those yearning or simply wanting to experience an ambience analogous to that of a big city. There has been one thing that we have not liked from this place, however. And it is the inconsistency in service. In part it is directly related to the heavy reliance the owner and cooks have on part-time help. Some times there would be a server who would forget your order, or sometimes you would call on the phone and they would forget that you ordered. But, let me emphasize, this does not happen often.

Cabo fired back... with authority.\n\nFor starters, our friend Kat had gotten the Veggie Roll and was kind enough to let me taste it.  One word: Glorious. It is portabella and wild mushrooms, yellow squash, zucchini, and the usual works. It was presented in sushi style (bigger portions) topped with tequila lime aioli. This was also served with salad on the side. \n\nI had requested to have a sample of their Soy Ginger Shrimp Taco and the Tavarua Tuna Taco. The soy ginger taco came with beer battered shrimps that were tossed in a soy ginger glaze, stuffed with cabbage, tomato, avocado, monterey jack and cheddar cheese topped altogether with sesame seeds to taste. The shrimp were juicy and plump; tasty and savory good. The Tavarua Tuna Taco was delightfully fresh; definitely not dry this time around. You can taste all the ingredients well and how they complemented each other on your palate. To pair, I had a glass of their sparkling, potable Cabo water. \n\nThe Lover is not as adventurous and as random as I am. He ordered the Carne Asada Steak Burrito again. This time it was not disappointing for he devoured that thing in 2 minutes --- the whole thing! Good? I'd say it was a lot better than the first one. (Beer pairing to be posted soon.. The Lover isn't here and I can't remember for the life of me what it was he drank that night). \n\nThe tortillas were fresh. And like last time, the masher was AMAZING.\n\nSo overall, Cabo has proven to be a respected taco joint in our book.

There is definitely something celebratory about this place, and I'll get to that in a bit...But it feels somewhat out of place to have a fancy steakhouse with a Jeeveish waiter and classical music playing in the background when you know that college kids are getting hammered only 10 minutes away. Anyway, snooty server and pretentiousness aside, the Farmhouse does offer quite good food. \n\nThe steak was quite juicy, though simply dressed. Fettucine alfredo was luscious with a white sauce that included egg as one of its ingredients.

You would think that they would bother to clean it up.\n\nAlso note to fire marshall - you may want to give this place an inspection.  Not only was it so packed that you literally had to fight to get through the crowd, the upstairs balcony rail was wobbling so much that I am positive it will fall off as soon as a fat drunk slob leans on it.  This place is a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nAlso TOTS is the biggest sausage fest outside of Munich Germany.  Seriously the ratio here was 30-1 generously.  It might as well be a gay bar.  Since there are no girls here I guess the dudes feel comfortable passing gas.  We were dropped ass on no less than 3 times while there.\n\nThey should change the name of the city to Dropassburg.....\n\nDO NOT GO HERE.

While they do offer a lot of games (pool, shuffleboard, etc) and such, their service is just horrible. I would give it 0 stars if I could. \n\nA large group of us came here the other day. It is right after graduation so as expected, Blacksburg is a ghost town. Considering the fact that we were bringing business to a place with only a handful of people there before we showed up, you\'d think we\'d get decent service, but no.\n\nThe waitress was BEYOND rude. She kept saying something about having to deal with undergrads and serving all the people that came for Graduation all week. I mean I get that it\'s tiring, but that doesn\'t mean you can drop the ball and be a jerk to everyone who comes in. It also doesn\'t mean that ANYONE came to this bar to hear this girl complain about her job. She was short and just so disinterested in doing her job.\n\nWe wanted to get some food and when we looked at the menu, a girl in our group asked if there was anything gluten free on the menu that she could suggest. She quickly snapped that they "don\'t serve gluten free food and that she should go somewhere else like The Cellar." My friend has been to Champs several times before and each time, they have been able to accommodate her needs happily. Truth of the matter is, there were items on the menu that could be made gluten free, but the bartender just didn\'t seem to want to be bothered by it. We all found it especially rude. My friend decided to not let this lame girl put a damper on her day so she just went to the other room and played some games with the other people we were with.\n\nFast forward to a few minutes later. The guys in our group were getting hungry and decided maybe they\'d try to order some food. When one of them went up to order, the girl told him they "didn\'t have anymore food." WHAT?! She said this to his face as other people around him were getting served all kinds of food. I don\'t know what her deal was and I really don\'t care - there\'s no excuse for that kind of behavior. I wish we would have said something to the manager because her attitude was out of control. She SUCKED. \n\nWe decided to go somewhere else after we finished our drinks because clearly nothing good was going to come of sticking around at this place. \n\nAll 10 of us left and took our business to some of the other places downtown and we had an easy time getting better service .\n\nThe thing that baffles me most is that it\'s SUMMER in Blacksburg. Nobody is here. There\'s no reason you should act like you are stretched so thin that you can\'t provide good service.\n\nOh well, lesson learned. Neither of us will ever go to this horrendous bar again and we\'ll go ahead and let our departments know not to have any functions here either.\n\nTHE WORST.', 'business_id': '3juObN8h-4AZfaxLDhPtQw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2012-05-16', 'type': 'review'}

They also seem to have an ant issue, because every time that I sit at the bar I always notice an ant or two stroll by. \n            The first time I went, I ordered the Mousakka, which was a menu special for that particular day. Their\'s consisted of eggplant, ground beef, cheese, and sausage all sort of layered together. I love all of those ingredients individually so I thought why not. They bring you a plate of it, which is a solid 6 inches thick and was clearly baked in the oven. The result, the interior is ice cold while the tops and sides are piping hot. When I came back months later, I ordered the baked ziti with meatballs, something I had been craving. I was expecting a nice plate of ziti with a few meatballs on top and the whole thing coated with mozzarella cheese. Instead, I get the baked ziti with meatballs Mousakka style! It was a 6 inch thick lasagna looking dish that even had the meatballs inside of it. This time though, I had the opposite issue. The exterior was burnt while the interior was warm. The meatballs were comparable to the ones that you buy at Subway or some lousy sub shop. They are absolutely clueless when it comes to cooking Italian style food or running a restaurant in general.', 'business_id': '76hIZMzHZ_lFM0p2N7_gRQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2011-08-20', 'type': 'review'}

The apartments are old, well worn (lots of visible paint layers, poor carpentry), and appliances are not modern (cheapest management can find in good condition).\n\nParking: Lots of parking located all throughout facility. Not covered. Not assigned. So if you're having friends over or have multiple vehicles, no problem.\n\nNoise: The walls are medium thickness, but the floor/ceiling has no noise insulation at all - you hear EVERYTHING above or below you. Avoid the 2nd story for this reason. Try to get professional/grad housing for quieter neighbors, as you will hear everything.\n\nGrounds: Buildings are uninspired and dull. Absolutely boring/ugly. However, the grass is well kept, there are nice fields (especially by the pond) for sports. The tennis courts, basketball courts, and pools are fun - but are often crowded when it is nice out.\n\nSafety: I left my apartment unlocked almost the entire time there. I had packages left at my door for days at a time without worrying. My vehicle was often unlocked. Never had any concern for my safety at Foxridge. There is no security service, but it is not a high-crime area by any means.\n\nConstruction: Everything was made to be as cost-efficient as possible in the building. Cheap wood buildings with hastily carpentry inside.\n\nMaintenance: Quality of work is not the best, but there is 24-hour service. They respond quickly.\n\nStaff: The staff has too many tenants to manage and is usually clueless when you ask them a question.

This review will be styled in nine circles just like Dante\'s Inferno!\n\nLet\'s start with the basics. The place is nice looking on the outside and it\'s really big! It took some time to find the main entrance to the restaurant. Originally we only saw the banquet room entrance. The restaurant has a nice lawn, pretty flowers and benches outside for waiting. Be prepared to wait on graduation day or other big events as the Farmhouse has a difficult time upholding reservations.\n\nFirst Circle:\nWe had a 7.30 reservation. We arrived at 7.15. We were told it would be about 45 minutes. What? But, we had a reservation?! Let the waiting games begin.  We waited outside and each female in our party took turns asking the hostess how much longer the wait would be, each time being told, not much longer.  After while and after speaking with other waiting groups who also had reservations we learned that the Farmhouse was not really acknowledging reservations. Well, isn\'t that strange! One of the biggest days in Blacksburg and reservations were basically on the back burner? Hmmmm.  \n\nSecond Circle:\nAfter my grandma went in to talk to the waitress we all filed in after 5 minutes of her inside and we were told we would be seated. And then we waited. And waited in the very crowded front foyer. We waited about 10 minutes. Then we were moved along to an inner corner of the restaurant.\n\nThird Circle:\nWe are waiting outside of a mystery room next to a wooden statue of a very large lion, an Indian and who knows what else. It\'s very quiet and creepy.  I\'m scared.\n\nFourth Circle:\nWe are actually seated at the table! A very friendly, professional waitress comes, fills our water glasses and takes orders. And then leaves. While looking around we see lots of other patrons with the same expression on their face of, "how long will this take?" We decide to be positive, but there\'s only so much you can take. The wait staff is phenomenal. The banquet room is loud, it\'s a bit dated...\n\nFifth Circle:\nWe ask for bread, and more bread and yet more bread after we placed our dinner orders. My aunt and I go through a bottle of wine. We eat more bread. Our salads come after hmmm 30 minutes. Again, the waitstaff is doing a fantastic job. Something is very very wrong though.... Could it be management?\n\nSixth Circle:\nOur food comes after about an hour. At this point, I don\'t really care to eat anymore. It\'s after 10:00pm. Remember we arrived at 7.15?  I\'ve had a lot of bread, water and wine at this point. I don\'t even know how the food tastes and I don\'t care.\n\nSeventh Circle:\nMy aunt requests to speak with a manager. A manager comes over, offers excuses and doesn\'t really do anything. My aunt asks for a generous discount. Manager says she\'ll have to speak with General manager.\n\nEighth Circle:\nGeneral manager comes over. I recognize her. She\'s the one who brought us to the third circle! What is going on here?!  General Manager explains that they kept taking people even though the kitchen was backed up and "it\'s not your fault" said to my aunt... Well, no I don\'t think it is any patron\'s fault for a poor management decision. After a soft conversation with this manager, my aunt and the manager come to a deal. \n\nNinth and last circle:\nWe leave after 10:30pm close to 11:00. This was a very long evening and very memorable one way or the other.\n\nHeaven!\nI said the waitstaff was phenomenal and they were! They were so professional, friendly, courteous and well-composed, even though they were being over-worked. I thanked our waitress after the meal to say how great of a job she and all the others did. Our drinks were kept full, when we asked for more bread, we received more bread and everyone was so attentive, except for management.  \n\n9 circles of breakdown:\nThe food: The bread was good, the salad was ok, I guess my entree was fine.\nThe experience: A great wait staff! That\'s it.\nThe value: very expensive for what it is.\nWould I return?: No. If you are in blacksburg, I recommend not going on a special event weekend.\n2 stars?: I was going to give one star, but decided that the wait staff earned an extra star. Sadly, I cannot give 3 stars to this restaurant.', 'business_id': 'lE_jefQ2F9PSjtNmNTSFIA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-05-15', 'type': 'review'}

Brian was server. He took our orders and moved on to the couple behind us to take their order. \n\nHe came back after 5 minutes to ask us if he took our order yet because he "couldn\'t remember." This was a bit alarming since he just took it a few minutes ago. \n\nWe sat and enjoyed chatting about things until we noticed quite some time had passed. The restaurant had maybe 10 people in it and the couple behind us got their burgers and food before we even got our salad & wraps. \n\nI began to get irritated that perhaps Brian \'did\' forget our order. He finally brought us our food after 35 minutes. I had a soda and needed a refill. I had set it on the edge so he could see and he asked if we needed anything. My husband politely asked him if I could have a refill on my empty soda. \n\nThe ironic part is he was super-hero fast with bringing our bill in which he charged for full Caesar salad when I had asked for side. It\'s a minor detail but I can never finish a full size salad and it just shows he did not listen to any detail. \n\nOverall, I had thought it\'d be another chain of Red Robin but this one took the cake for being the worst I\'ve ever stepped in. \n\nWon\'t be back.', 'business_id': 'kjrq7LOaMawzLTVlLMpApQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2011-10-13', 'type': 'review'}

The establishment was moderately filled, but it took over 30-45 minutes to get an order of 10 wings and 4 burnt chicken tenders.\n\nAs far as the bar is concerned, they finally got Killians off tap upstairs, which is good since it tasted like soap for 5+ years.  Hopefully they replaced/cleaned the line before replacing it with something else.  I\'ve only hung out downstairs once, and that was to play shuffleboard.  The rest of the times I\'ve been there I\'ve hung out upstairs, mostly to play pool.  It looks like they reupholstered the tables since the last time I was there, which was a pleasant surprise.  There\'s a shuffleboard table upstairs, too, so there\'s stuff to do.  Some might be interested to know that you can smoke upstairs, presumably because they have 2 separate bars and ventilation systems, so don\'t go upstairs without expecting to smell like ass afterward.\n\nReally, the only reason I went here this past time was because my friend knew the bartender and either got a great deal or was paying for everyone w/ his company card.  Free beer is always better, but I probably won\'t ever say, "Hey, let\'s go to Hokie House!"', 'business_id': 'Ij5vTLLpmulfCsK64jGGxw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2010-11-08', 'type': 'review'}

This place by far has the best tasting coffee in town (and I believe I\'ve been to every coffee shop in town). It\'s brewed on sight and there\'s a huge variety. The cafe is impeccably clean and there\'s a lot of great seating, particularly at their counter. Their hours are fantastic, particularly for early risers such as myself -- I believe they open at 6am (although I\'m not a fan of the 10PM close time near a university, but to be fair, every cafe in town closes at around that hour). \n           Now for the negatives. The food is really lousy. The sandwiches are completely boring and unoriginal and honestly -- anyone is perfectly capable of making one of their sandwiches at home for a 5th the price. It\'s really just bland cold cuts from any grocery store. I can\'t really compliment them on their breakfast items as they don\'t really appear to make any of it themselves. The pastries are shipped in and covered with this tacky looking clear wrap. The same thing applies to the bagels -- imported and clear wrapped. Their oatmeal is boxed --  straight out of the grocery store. Honestly, if they want a 4th star, they need to really improve on the food side. \n           The other big negative there is service. The people who work there are professional and take your order, but they\'re all pretty introverted. I\'ve been going there sporadically for about 2 years and I don\'t think any of them know my name or care to know. I order the same exact thing every time I go in and I still get asked by them what I want everyday and I\'m pretty confident that they really have no idea what I want. I stopped going there for about a 3 month stretch and came back and there wasn\'t a "Hey long time no see," or "Hey where have you been." It was like they had never seen me before and the scary part is is that I\'ve actually had conversations with a few of them. You can have an entire conversation with someone who works there -- see them the next day -- and they\'ll completely forget who you are. I mean, I don\'t want them to have artificial personalities like most Starbucks employees where they\'re fake nice to you, but Jeez I\'ve been going there for 2 years you should at least recognize me. They\'re like robots. \n           I would imagine that their robotic personalities stem from the top. The owner Scott seems to run a tight ship, but he\'s the only aggressive introvert I\'ve ever seen in my life. He hardly ever utters a word, but when say a telemarketer calls he\'ll snap at them with the ferocity of a drill sergeant. I\'ve had one bad experience there (which is what prompted me to stop going for 3 months)... I brought in a sandwich from Sub Station down the street and ordered a coffee. I was at the counter eating my food and he snapped, "Don\'t bring in outside food again. You know that we have sandwiches here!" At this point, I had been going there everyday for about a year and a half and this was the first sentence he had ever said to me. Honestly, Mill Mountain just needs to shake up their culture. Their employees (and owner) need to become a bit more social. Their real saving grace is that their coffee is absolutely fantastic and that they\'re the only place open in the early morning hours.', 'business_id': '4MPACVneQtpnTbzHavn1fQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-08-20', 'type': 'review'}

This place reopened and we decided to give them a try.  Greasy spoon is a compliment.  Cheapest grade of restaurant food the vendor must provide.  You are going to need some Rolaids or Alka Seltzer if you try it.  My daughter ordered cheese nachos with extra cheese.  The server said there would be an additional charge for the extra cheese and that was okay as long as we got the extra cheese.  I specifically asked her to tell the cook to layer the cheese and not just sprinkle on top. The nachos took forever to arrive and when they did they did not have enough cheese...forget any extra.  It was a sprinkle of shredded cheese on top.  I told the server to remove the charge for extra cheese because we did not get it.  My daughter only ate some of the top layer of the nachos and left a plateful of non-cheesed nachos.  The entrees: one kid's meal of the ham and cheese sub and one grilled chicken wrap. Both with fries.  The sub and the wrap were awful.  We did not get past a few bites.  The fries were the frozen crinkle cut type that were still white and cold.  I asked our server for fresh crispy fries, please.  She seemed offended and walked off.  No apology.  Nothing.  It took about 20 minutes of no server and  empty drink glasses as we sat.  She finally reappeared with fries that looked about the same but were warm. I asked for refills and the server let out a big sigh like I as being unreasonable.  I am sitting at the table full of barely touched food that I can not eat.  May I please have a refill of soda?  We were over the experience at that point and asked for our bill.  Just pay and run out as fast as you can. \n\nThe kitchen is open and the cook asked as we walked by if everything was alright.  I calmly told him that our food was inedible and we would not be back.  He shrugged his shoulders and went back to the grill.  I am glad he did not care because I certainly don't care to darken their doorstep again. I have heard their breakfasts are better.

In fact our experience here just made me love this chain even more!\n\nWe ate there last night. 3 adults (one of our kids is 15), and 4 children (ages 8-10). The total bill for 7 of us came to $ 40 and some change. \n\nThey not only happily GIVE a military discount but if you are in uniform, your meal is free. We ate here to celebrate when my husband came home from Iraq, literally as soon as he got off the plane so he was still in uniform and they gave him his meal for free. \n\nThis restaurant chain had never disappointed with it\'s cleanliness, charming atmosphere, and impeccable service or price.\n\nThe greatest thing about Red Robin for bigger families is their bottomless meals! Seriously as a mother of 5, this concept is un-heard of!!! They have a childrens menu where the kids can color it and circle what they want to eat (takes the pain out of offering for 4 smaller kids), bring out cups with lids, AND (one of the kids just noticed last night) that they have a game of I spy on the cups to keep the kids busy!!! Kudos to the person who thought of that!! Instead of listening to who was touching who and who was being mean we heard, "cool!!!" While the game occupied them and opened them up to looking around the restaurant at all the neat stuff they have on the walls. Before we knew it.....DING....food was served.\n\nWhen you first walk in they have a tv in the floor! My kids are obsessed with standing on it and before we know it, we are being seated without having to hear the typical "we\'re hungry" that parents usually hear while standing in line to be seated. And as my son informed me, they have a tv in the boys bathroom...so be prepared for your kid to keep having to go to the bathroom, lol.\n\nTwo of my kids ordered the cheese pizza, one ordered the cheeseburger, and the other ordered the mac and cheese. All but one got the steak fries and the other got apple slices. ALL BOTTOMLESS! If you haven\'t experienced this yet, everything that the kids ordered....they could have as much as they wanted for no extra charge! My son ended up getting a second cheeseburger and the other a second pizza. You absolutely can not beat that especially for larger families when your kids are going through a growth spurt and one portion isn\'t quite filling.\n\nThey also have bottomless drinks, I just dont remember which ones but the different flavored Iced Teas were on there and they are good!!! \n\nThey also serve mixed drinks which is very nice for Mom and Dad!\n\nWhile we were sitting there eating, the Manager came around and stopped at every table to personally check on the customers needs. He stopped at our table, joked around with the kids and continuously asked if we needed anything and how our service was. That was very nice and made us feel like our every need was met. I watched the manager walk around to every table to check on his customers, it kind of made us feel like we were part of the Red Robin family! \n\nExcellent parking, smoke-free environment, super friendly staff, great food, great prices, fun atmosphere, comfortable dining experience, and not just kid-friendly....KID WELCOMING without the adults feeling like it\'s a kids restaurant. I can\'t say enough good things about Red Robin, and have not one bad thing to say and we\'ve had the RR EXPERIENCE about 4 times in two different locations. \n\nAnd they also do sing Happy Birthday and I think you get a complimentary desert and they have a RR online club for deals.', 'business_id': 'kjrq7LOaMawzLTVlLMpApQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-02-23', 'type': 'review'}

We've also ordered the curry chicken, which tasted like curry, but once again, the chicken was a bit bland.  We also ordered beef one time, but it was similarly bland.  Their shrimp fried rice is still good though! (better than the rice they serve on campus)\n\nThe prices are also pretty cheap, and they're open until 11:00PM every day, so it's easy to get food after the dining centers at Virginia Tech close.

The presentation of the food is unimpressive too, but somehow, the way they cook the meat/seafood and the rice, and those candied carrots... it somehow keeps you coming back for more. I guess they cook everything hibachi-style, but it has neither the nasty buttery taste or overly expensive pricing of Kabuki in Christiansburg.

Both items were superb. For my entree, I ordered the BBQ Mahi Tacos with the Jalapeno Cheddar Mashers. Like my Charlotte visit, I loved the tacos I ordered. Also like my Charlotte visit, I was underwhelmed with my side. The mashers had a great spice but were dense, lukewarm and lacking seasoning. One of my sisters ordered the Tavarua Tuna Tacos also with the Jalapeno Cheddar Mashers as the side and she agreed with my underwhelming sentiment but thought the tacos were excellent. The Baja Chicken Bowl my other sister ordered was large and had a unique presentation. It had good flavor, but the chicken was a little dry. My mom ordered the seasonal veggies with her Blackened Mahi Tacos and seemed to enjoy both. So in my personal opinion, a couple of the side items need some improvement.

Service has varied - Monday nights are incredibly crowded, so sometimes there is a wait for seating, and they also had us finish ordering sushi by 9pm (even though the restaurant closed at 10pm), so be careful if you get there late.  One waitress was incredibly nice and friendly, although I didn't find that to be the norm (maybe just because they are so crazy busy on Monday nights and are therefore sometimes a little hard to track down). Although - like another reviewer said, they always keep my tea and water refilled, and that's a huge plus for me.\n\nThe $1 sushi deal gets you $1 nigiri (per piece), an average of a little under $3 for selected maki rolls (the eel roll is great), and I think $2.00 off of the special rolls.  Overall, the raw fish quality has been good. Sometimes the rolls fall apart a bit, but they always taste fresh.  Don't try substituting though - I tried to ask about substituting something in one of the rolls that was $2 off - they said that they would take away the $2 off, plus charge an additional $2 or something for the substitution... that seemed pretty extreme to me.  Maybe others will have better luck with this.\n\nI agree with another reviewer that charging for green tea is bogus.  And actually, they charge $2.50 for tea now - that's really expensive for something that in most other Japanese restaurants is free.  I'd love to see them add something with shrimp tempura to the half-off specials.\n\nI'd recommend giving it a try.  The ambiance inside is delightful and it's a great place for a date or with a group of friends.

Maybe it is the fact that most guys head to Bennys after a night of drinking and feel the need to prove something. There's always a feeling in the air that a fight is about to break out. I feel like this place could use a bouncer or two and that should not be the case for a pizza joint.", 'business_id': 'bsqCkCccS5LY1X5Ub75JBQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-09-24', 'type': 'review'}

I came for a simple trimming of my ends because they were drying out, and I was overcharged for such a simple job. It was $32 for something I could have done myself :/ I was really unhappy with the service at the front desk, but was too timid to just walk out because I felt it\'d be rude (I had called in earlier to make an appointment). The receptionist didn\'t look up once at me while I was at the counter! When I came in, she didn\'t say hello or guide me on what I should do, so I was left looking confused at the counter. She didn\'t acknowledge me until I said, "Uhm, hi?", and even then she didn\'t look up. While still looking at her computer she asked what I was there for. I told her I had an appointment for the "express cut" and she told me to have a seat while pointing to a waiting area with some chairs (note that she still had not looked up from her computer at this point). \n\nThe woman who was scheduled to cut my hair (she didn\'t introduce herself) seemed a little nervous when she came out to get me. Long story short I was charged $32 for something I was told would be $25 (the express cut), and the woman who cut it didn\'t even style my hair for that extra $7. When I asked the receptionist why I was being charged extra her response was, "Blow-dry. $32." Really?\n\nThis place is very unprofessional and inexperienced. Having given 3 salons in Blacksburg a chance and being disappointed with all of them my conclusion is - don\'t bet your luck here.

In all honesty, i have only been to the wine bar area but the overall atmosphere is very unique to the area.  The "house" is divided into 3 main area\'s - main restaurant, wine/beer bar and a regular bar with pool tables/tv\'s/etc (which is seperated for noise purposes).  They have a piano player that sits in the main dining area that can also be heard in the wine bar.\nI have been to the wine bar on 2 different occasions and both have been very good experiences.  Within the wine bar, they have booths, tables as well as a few leather couches/chairs.\nThe service is very good.  The hostess was very nice and explained their layout and then took me to the requested wine bar area.  Both times i have sat in the leather sofa section.  Not only did the server check on me quite often, the hostess came by on occasion to make sure everything was all right.\nFor food, i have only had the appitizers.  I have had the spinach artichoke dip and the buffalo chicken flatbread pizza.  Both were really good and seemed very fresh.  I have seen entree\'s ordered within the wine bar area and they have each looked very good as well.\nThe wine list has lots of whites and reds to choose from.  The hostess mentioned that they have a few staples but they also rotate the list quite often.  The wines are priced very fair which allows you to venture out and try different styles.\nOverall, i rate this a great experience in Blacksburg.

We were really happy to see several breakfast options marked as "can be made animal free".   I was immediately bummed to find out there wasn\'t a vegan grits option or pancake option (so damn easy to make vegan), but we pressed on. Husband ordered the tofu scramble with home fries and soy milk, and I got a veganized version of some other thing that ended up looking exactly like my husband\'s dish, but with just cubed tofu.   What bummed me out was the only vegan bread they offered was dry, toasted baguette slices. It seems like if you\'re going to specifically tout yourself as having vegan options, at least keep some vegan margarine on hand so us vegans don\'t have to nibble on dry white bread. The tofu "scramble" (actually cubed, not scrambled, but I know this can be a regional thing) was pretty good all slathered in BBQ sauce. The home fries were absolutely perfect. Super greasy and really awesome.  We were brought room temperature soy milk along with ice filled glasses. The server told us that they didn\'t have any soymilk in stock, so they stepped out to get us some. A nice gesture, but I wonder why no soymilk? Not enough vegans in this college town?\n\nThe service was friendly, and our bellies were filled and ready for our 10 hour drive back home.

I went there often with my friends during my undergrad. years and I always try to eat there at least once when I go down to visit.  \n\nAppetizers: \n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa they give you are very good.  The salsa has chunks of corn, tomatoes, and cilantro.  It\'s very fresh and flavorful and we usually finish the whole thing before our food comes out! \n\nTheir Baja Shrimp and Crab Dip is THE bomb.  At first, you can\'t really see the shrimp and crab, but once you bite into it, you can definitely tastes the chunks.  The pita slices that come with it is so warm, chewy, and just a perfect compliment to the dip.  \n\nThe Spinach and Artichoke Dip is also very delicious.  This was my favorite appetizer at Cabo, until I tried the Shrimp and Crab Dip.  \n\nTheir Crispy Calamari is also quite good and doesn\'t have that, I guess, "fishy" taste calamari from other places have, but I think I would choose one of the dips over this. \n\nSalads: \n\nThe Diablo Shrimp Salad is very fresh and the portion size is HUGE.  The shrimp are jumbo sized and super plump.  My mom and sister took one bite of mine and then kept coming back for more. \n\nDuring my most recent visit, I ordered the Sweet Blackened Tuna Salad, but they had run out of sashimi style tuna, so my tuna was cooked well done.  Although I was a bit disappointed I couldn\'t get the sashimi tuna, the salad was still very delicious.  Their mango-pineapple chutney is also very fresh and flavorful.  My mom loves it over her rice. \n\nTacos: \n\nI usually get the BBQ Mahi Tacos, which are so delicious.  This was what I got when I went to Cabo for the first time and it was the reason why I fell in love with the place.  Cabo definitely does not skimp on the huge chunks of fish they put in the taco and all the ingredients are so fresh and flavorful.  My mom is usually very picky about food, and she didn\'t really want to go to Cabo when I first brought it up.  After one bite of this taco, she also fell in love with the place and we\'ve been back about 3 times together since. I also usually get the baja rice as my side, which is rice with their mango-pineapple chutney over it.  The mango-pineapple is very fresh and adds a very refreshing splash to the rice.  \n\nThe Bar:\n\nThey have a nice selection of beer, but I usually get their Original Caborita Margarita.  You can definitely taste the tequila and it isn\'t too too sweet, which I love.  \n\nOverall, the service is great, the food is awesome, and the drinks are super yummy.

Now they're tiny, limp globs of oil.\n\n-The gumbo used to be flavorful, and all soup dishes came with some fine cornbread.  The gumbo is now a salty mess, and the cornbread has disappeared.\n\n-Good cuts of meat were used for steak salads and other dishes.  Now they've switched to cheaper cuts, and the steak is fatty, chewy, and disgusting.\n\n-The weekend brunch used to be great (their biscuits and gravy were the best I'd ever put in my mouth).  However, on my last 2 visits, my order was burned on the bottom.\n\nBoudreaux's gets a bonus star for their drinks.  The mojitos are amazing, the brunch drinks are strong, the beer selection is good, and the Wine Wednesday special (where all bottles are half-price) is definitely worth checking out.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't recommend Boudreaux's for anything more than that.

The interior is minimalist with a big chalkboard advertising their specials.  What's special about Green's is that yes, they do serve sushi and mediterranean and indian inspired cuisine.  This is a great concept for a college town because many friends can come together to eat at one restaurant.  What also makes Green's special is that they do a good job preparing, cooking and serving the variety of food and it tastes great too!\n\nWe ordered a small feast for four at Green's last Sunday and it was quite delicious.  We ordered four different sushi rolls and the tikka masala platter.  The rolls were really great and the Volcano Roll was perhaps divine inspiration from the sushi gods.  The Rainbow roll was a bounty of fresh fish and seafood.  The Volcano roll was not too spicy, but really just a fantastic special roll with a lot of seafood and a lot of yummy in my tummy! The Alaska roll featured smoked salmon, which isn't my favorite, but roll it in seaweed with other ingredients and the smoke flavor just lends this really delicious flavoring agent to the other ingredients.  Finally the spicy tuna was delicious, as it should be.\n\nThe tikka masala platter was also very tasty, having had just a bite of chicken, but the serving was enormous and the flavors were good. Even the rice had some spice and that shows attention-to-detail!\n\nTo Green's: Well done! Keep it up! Keep that sushi raw and keep that chicken cooked!\n\nGreen's Breakdown:\nThe food: Well, it was delicious. I'm very happy with that discovery in Blacksburg.\nThe value: I'd call it well priced sushi.  Make sure you check out their specials for even more values.\nThe experience: I like the minimalism in the decor.

The chicken was a little tough, and the spaghetti tasted like it was from a box. The surf and turf, a 6 oz filet and a lobster tail, was served with asparagus and a strange deep-fried ball of mashed potatoes and cheese.

The asparagus was grilled, but so cooked that the tips were completely black, and unedible. The lobster was a good size, and very tender and well-cooked. The salads (Caesar and Greek) were just okay, although they were ample portions.\n\n2 stars for the prices: The special surf and turf (price not shown on the menu) was $43.

I was holding onto that extra star because the first time I went here I had a good experience, albeit I also had three glasses of wine to sweeten the deal.\n\n*To get to the \'good stuff\' you can skip down to the narrative*\n\nI did not feel good about giving this restaurant anymore than 1 star after the service I received tonight. I am not generally a zealous reviewer, but I feel compelled to share.\n\nThe night began averagely. The server was OK, seemingly a bit sarcastic and dry, however I chalked it up to his creative license and ability to be an individual and had expectations of receiving average if not above average service, as he seemed nice enough.\n\nIt took a while for the bread to arrive however I was excited as I was told it was in the oven. I imagined hot and soft bread arriving at my table. The bread that arrived was lukewarm, which made me think the waiter probably just forgot to bring the bread and instead blamed the wait on the oven. The olive oil given with the bread was very low quality. \n\nItalian food is my favorite food. I love the Chicago\'s Little Italy American Italian food all the way down to Mama\'s kitchen in Sicily. I love it all! It is hard to displease me! However this olive oil was something more akin to cheap store brand olive oil than authentic Italian standard olive oil. As dipping olive oil, it was very thin and tasted like vegetable oil.\n\nI asked for Steamed Asparagus with olive oil, garlic, and Parmesan to start. A dish not on the menu but a classic I love to start with. The restaurant obliged. The dish was averagely done, however as it was not on the menu I was pleased I still received it. \n\nMy second appetizer (however it arrived first) was the Fried Ravioli. The ravioli were oily and bland. The marinara sauce was essentially tomato paste, which I love either way. I seasoned it with some lemon wedges to add flavor. The overall experience was unmemorable.\n\nMy third dish was the Spinach and Cheese Ravioli. I bit into the Ravioli and almost immediately I could tell there was something \'off\' about the dish. Upon further inspection, I realized what I thought was cheese was actually lasagna pasta. The pasta was so over cooked, that is was mushy and stuck to the ridges of my teeth like gum you keep in your mouth overnight and then have to scrape off of the roof of your mouth. I have seen over cooked pasta before, but nothing like this!\n\n-----\n\nI can forgive all kitchen mishaps with just a little bit of positive customer service and some attention to detail, but what followed has me certain I will not be returning nor recommending this place to ANYONE.\n\nI asked the waiter (Server I.D. #18) when he returned if the pasta "was usually this consistency."\n\nHe asked "what issue I had with it."\n\nI said it "was gummy and chewy." \n\nHe asked me nonchalantly "how did I want it? Less chewy?" And he began to laugh.\n\nHe proceeded to tell me varying things, including "that\'s just how they make their pasta, and that I should ask the waiter next time to make the pasta harder."\n\nWHAT?!  He did not apologize for the dish, offer to note it to the chef, ask me if I would like it redone, or offer to remove it from the bill, although I had taken all but two bites.\n\nI told him that pasta has a particular consistency when it is done, and mushy means it is overcooked.\n\nHe then tried to convince me that there was no such thing as the \'right way\' to cook pasta and that it was just my personal opinion. LITERALLY, HE SAID, "To each their own" with a smirk.\n\nI glanced around the restaurant to see if other people were experiencing the same awful service or if any fellow waitstaff had noted his rudeness and incompetence. NOPE! \n\nI asked him for the check and pushed the pasta away.\n\nHe said, "Should I take this away?"\n\nI responded \'Yes\'\n\nHe then laughed and said, "Was it that bad? Should I remove it from your sight?"\n\nI then told him, "The pasta is overcooked, I am sorry you do not consider your customers opinions important. It is not my taste buds to blame here."\n\nHe brought me the check offhandedly and said, "I hope you come back again. Maybe we can find something to your liking."\n\nAnother waiter at this point had noticed the interaction, however did she intrude to find out why I was clearly disappointed and annoyed? Nope. She glance over, printed out a receipt, and left. \n\nNo one said anything to me while I waited for the check, or as I walked out.\n\nA restaurant is only as great as its food and its people. Zeppoli\'s food is slightly above average; their people are WAY below average. Zeppoli\'s, you are in the RED. And that is NEVER good for business.\n\n(I hope they kept my waiter from my first experience. She was a dream compared to this guy.

They offer daycare at certain times, so you can work out while the kids play. Daily use lockers in a clean but no frills locker room (bring your own lock).

Eric is very willing to work with your specific needs, so just tell him what your goals are and what is or isn't working for you.

And then you eat there a couple of times and you realize you're starting to like it more and more each time, and you wonder if it's because it's really better than you first realized or if your standards are just getting that low.\n\nWell, if you want Japanese food, don't go here. For that matter, don't really go anywhere in Blacksburg (Blacksburg has some okay sushi, but anything else Japanese- and there's a lot more to Japanese cuisine than just sushi- be wary). But if you want something quick and meaty, with names that sound like Japanese food but have really nothing to do with the food in question, go here.\n\nEveryone raves about the Hokie sauce, which I think is something like a heavily watered down Thousand Island but I'm not entirely positive, but it's just a strange condiment to add to something that's supposed to be Japanese food. Unfortunately, the chicken (or beef) is always dried out to the point that you actually need to use the Hokie sauce just to get some kind of moisture in your food.\n\nWhat saves this place, however, is the Hokie fish. It's always cooked well and has a nice teriyaki-style glaze that just works, and you don't even need the Hokie sauce for it- it's good enough to eat on its own. Get it with broccoli and you have a pretty decent meal.\n\nI hate bashing locally owned, mom and pop places, but this place has plenty of fans, which never ceases to surprise me.

I think some bands might have a good time playing here, and a lot of the people seemed happy that there was music, but really, it's not conducive to really paying attention to song-lyrics. There is just too much talking and clinking of knives and forks and the sound from the kitchen carries all the way across the restaurant. But still I was grateful for the folks who made a point to sit up front, have a couple of drinks, listen to some songs and buy a CD. And for the tip envelopes right on each table. It was nice at the end of the night to find that all the diners had appreciated me!\n\nAfter the gig, I chose a bottle from the great beer selection and ordered Nori-crusted tofu with a soba noodle cake and wasabi aoili that was excelent. I think there was a vegetable with it, but I can't remember now. Super-yummy, though. \n\nThe woman I was staying with suggested that Gillie's was the best place in town for breakfast, so we went back the next day. Again, only 2 servers rushing around the place and it took us quite a while to get coffee. But I ordered the Frittata with feta, artichoke hearts, spinach, potatoes, tomatoes and olives.

The fish tacos are delicious, especially the BBQ Mahi tacos, as are the tuna stacks and most of the burritos (Wasabi Tuna was my favorite while I was there).  \n\nThere's only one caveat to the food, I think: it depends on who prepares your food.  This is probably true with any restaurant in a college town, but I've had some very good food here, and some food that really let me down, and I can always tell when it's someone who likes to cook and does it well, versus some schmuck just trying to make a dollar and doesn't care about the end product.  The usual giveaway: the temperature and consistency of the taco shell.  It should be warm and crispy, yet pliable.\n\nAs far as the bar is concerned, you'll probably end up drinking with a number of regulars/locals/employees.  Cabo has the best margaritas in the area, quality-wise (El Rodeo will give you the best bang for your buck with the Texas Jumbo Margarita), and if tequila is your thing, you'll be right at home.  Cabo offers every tequila available through the ABC in Virginia; last time I checked, that was 72 different tequilas.  If you finish them all (over time), you'll get your name on a plaque, and maybe even a t-shirt or something.\n\nParking can be a pain in the ass, but there is a parking garage over in Kent Square if you need a spot.  You run the risk of being towed if you park at the Bookstore across the street.  \n\nAll in all, Cabo's definitely a nice change of pace from the normal Blacksburg restaurant and bar.

Five stars here is equivalent to about three stars in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ah, a little slice of Berkeley in Blacksburg. Gillie's serves vegetarian (and some fish) breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. It is probably the best restaurant in town, in terms of creative and tasty dishes. Breakfast is superb, and I have gained a new appreciation for large fluffy buttermilk biscuits that I slather with quality jam sneaked (snuck?) in from home. I almost always opt for Red Earth (~$5 in 2008): scrambled eggs intermixed with spicy red potatoes and topped with salsa. The eggs are never dry or clumpy, the potatoes are usually perfectly tender and crispy on the outside, and the spicing can vary from medium to salty. Other varieties such as Chappie's Choice (cheese but no salsa) are similarly excellent. The tofu scramble is another good breakfast option. It's an enormous pile of tofu baked in a barbecue-style sauce. Lunches are also very good. My standard is the tofu reuben, although the specials are usually imaginative and tasty, too. For a southern-style breakfast, Gillie's even outperforms a spot that the New York Times raved about in Charleston, SC.", 'business_id': 'gomSgjEesyhMgdN8w2tBOA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2008-12-22', 'type': 'review'}

Bull and Bones was the hands down favorite.  They definitely got their name out.  I was in town for the VTech/ Duke game and my friend and I decided to hit this place up for some food.  Note:  Duke really sucks at football.\n\nWhen we walked in, we were quoted a wait time of an hour and 15 minutes.  However, the bar area was first come first serve.  The wait didn't end up being that long, which is a good thing because I was contemplating stealing wings off a guy's plate.  There was also a wing on the floor that I stared at for a good 10 minutes.\n\nMy friend and I decided to go with the ribs and ordered up a bunch of wings as well.  You know it is a good day when you end it being surrounded by meat.  The wings are pretty good.  Big size, smokey flavor...I would definitely recommend the house bbq wings.  The ribs were ginormous as well.  However, the ribs might not be what most people expect of ribs.  These ribs are grilled which leave them a little tough.  You have to tear the meat off the bones with your teeth...which doesn't bother me at all being the carnivore that I am.  Sometimes I like my ribs where the meat doesn't fall off the bone.  The cole slaw was ok.  I liked the sweet potato casserole side...tasted like a sweet potato stuffing.  We also had the Sun Lit Wit brews since my friend is a fan of Blue Moon.  Definitely pretty good, especially if you like Belgian wheats.  The next time I'm in town, I'm going to try their sampler which consists of 6 small glasses of their brews.\n\nDecor is not unlike that of a Gordon Biersch or other brew pubs.  Service was excellent.  I think the bar area could be organized better to allow for more standing room.  Also, they should have a few more bartenders especially on game days.  Parking isn't too bad, the shopping center has quite a few lots although you might find yourself walking a little bit.\n\nI like brew pubs like this.  Good atmosphere and good meat.

I did recently return to try their breakfast. The menu items were intriguing, giving a bit of an Italian twist to traditional breakfast food. I ended up splitting the Grand Combo Plate with my wife, (which is pancakes,eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, toast, & potatoes, nothing exciting) along with an order of beignets. They were out of fruit, so they offered to substitute with an item of our choice, no big deal. The potatoes were seasoned rather heavily, and the pancakes had a strong grainy taste.

However, I\'ve only been here twice, due to the fact that its relatively expensive. I paid my second visit to this restaurant last night. Unfortunately, the lights went out when our food came out. surprisingly however, not only was their backup generator hooked up to a few of the overhead lamps, but it was also hooked to the many HDTV\'s around the restaurant. smart on their part because the duke v tech game was on and the crowds of rowdy hokie fans over by the bar would have definitely left.\n\nI\'ve read the reviews on this restaurant and one thing stood out to me. Inconsistency. This is definitely accurate. The first time I had the ribs here they were so so, but when I had them again yesterday, it was absolutely amazing. Definitely the best I\'ve ever sunken my teeth in and tastier than the ribs found at TOTS. Although they weren\'t the fall-off-the-bone type at bull and bones, they were still full of flavor and tender.\n\nWe also had the shrimp and crab dip for the second time which was also delicious, but it was not accompanied with enough bread and also came out lukewarm. Definitely ask for more bread, because we only finished half the dip with the bread that came out with the plate. The dip came out with breadcrumbs on top this time which was odd, but did not really change the flavor.\n\nService was okay, our waiter kept disappearing on us... This is probably because he had to take over our table since our original waiter was not feeling well. \n\nI\'m not too big on beer, but my opinion on the beer here is that it IS tasty, but I\'d rather go with the beers that taste similar that you can get at the grocery store. For example the sun lit wit is similar to blue moon, and the maroon effect ale is similar to yeungling. From what I hear from friends, most only like two of the beers here. They also have happy hour specials every day of the week except Saturday. Their root beer is also quite tasty as well.\n\nAll in all, this place is like an "upscale restaurant" for us college kids, but more of a casual place for older adults.

Let me just say plainly that there is no good Chinese food in Blacksburg. \n\nThis is styled after any of those Americanized Chinese places with the pictures of all the entrees on the walls and the long list of a menu they had. I went after the general tso's chicken, something that is usually done consistently and is a staple of that kind of food.\n\nThe chicken was formed into spheres, yes- perfect spheres that had been frozen and deep fried. It wasn't even all white meat, and it just did not have the right textures. The sauce wasn't spicy enough to qualify as General Tso's either, that's the whole point, otherwise it's just sesame chicken without the sesame seeds. Regardless, the fact that my chicken didn't look like real food really got to me. \n\nMaybe they have other better things on the menu, you're probably better off just asking them to make something that they normally make for themselves. I just couldn't bring myself to go again, maybe I will just settle for a cheap lunch buffet when I have a craving instead.\n\nI just wish with the large Asian population in Blacksburg that there would be at least one decent place, but it's nothing compared to D.C.", 'business_id': 'kN6Ai2WOz8dEBC75l77iBg', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2009-08-19', 'type': 'review'}

The boyfriend had what I guess was their special burger of the day, which was the Chipotle BBQ Pork burger, and although I'm not a fan of blue-cheese I took a bite anyway and it was super-delicious!!! \n\nWe also decided to be fat kids and got dessert. I got their Cranberry-Walnut chocolate chip pie and OH MY GOD!!!! You realllllly need to try that. Randy got the Bourbon Pecan Pie, which was good..... buuuuuut.... mine was better. They make their own desserts and I really hope they make their pie crusts too because it was amazingly buttery, flaky and delicious. If they don't make their crusts I don't want to know. Just let me keep thinking they do.\n\nWhile we were ordering our food (to go) we looked over their extensive beer and wine lists (but mostly the beer) and they have a great selection! Lagunita's, Bell's, and other craft beers! \n\nThe service was good, too, I have to add! (Mostly because I'm a server)\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because all the toppings of the burger were on the bottom and I felt that it made the foundation (bun/bread, etc) kind of soggy.

We came on a Saturday and it was a little more crowded than usual, but 2 sandwiches shouldn't have taken that long to make.\n\nMy fiance got the Chicken cashew sandwich and said that the chicken was not marinated at all. It was just a piece of plain chicken that was grilled. The only flavor on the sandwich was the sauce they put on it and even that couldn't save the sandwich from being utterly bland.\n\nI got a turkey sandwich with bacon and goat cheese. It may have been their turkey club. The goat cheese was very flavorful, but I was a little disappointed that they used turkey deli meat. I thought I was going to get actual carved turkey breast. The deli meat was too salty for my taste. I just didn't think it was that good. \n\nI probably wouldn't come back here again. You can spend less and get more flavorful foods elsewhere.

Being from the San Gabriel Valley in CA (where you\'ll find some of the best Chinese restaurants outside of China) I tend to agree with the previous reviewer, but everything is relative. For one, food in Blacksburg just generally sucks. There really isn\'t a "good" restaurant in town (and by good, I\'m coming from a pretentious California food-snob perspective) and that includes Blacksburg\'s sad attempts at any kind of ethnic cuisine.\n\nChinese food here just isn\'t great. It\'s pretty much all Americanized (unless you\'re able to read the Chinese menu at Charlie\'s Chinese in Christiansburg) and even for Americanized Chinese, it\'s not very good. \n\nSo what\'s good about Double Dragon that I\'m willing to give it three stars? Well, it\'s fast, edible, and fresh-tasting. For the most part, the food isn\'t terribly bland like most of the food (Asian or otherwise) in the area, and has flavors somewhat approximating Chinese food. \n\nWhat I like: \n-Dumplings in hot chili oil- pretty decent, actually good for the area\n-Beef in scallion sauce- it\'s got flavor and stuff, so I like it.\n-Orange chicken- tastes like your typical orange chicken, which is a good thing for Blacksburg.\n\nWhat\'s okay:\n-fried dumplings- get them from Chinese Kitchen, they\'re much better there.\n-Broccoli in garlic sauce- the garlic sauce is bland, but at least the broccoli tends to be crisp\n-Lo Mein- this is something you don\'t find so much on the West Coast, but it\'s kinda like a mushier chow mein. You can probably get it better at other restaurants in the area.\n\nSo... Yeah, do I recommend it? Sure. If you want Chinese-American food, and you\'re stuck in Blacksburg, this place is totally fine. It\'s good, even. But if you can hop on the next jet outta Blacksburg and go to a real city with real food, you should do that instead.', 'business_id': 'kN6Ai2WOz8dEBC75l77iBg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-06-05', 'type': 'review'}

We stayed at the Inn on a recent trip, and we were impressed with the hotel as a whole.  We ate at Prestons the morning after St. Patrick's Day to try and absorb some of the previous day's festivities.  Brunch is a little expensive ($20pp), but well worth it. The food was of a good quality, and there was lots of it. This is the third time I've been to Preston's, the first for brunch. I was impressed with the biscuits and gravy, and the omelete station, as well as the crab and corn fritters, and the chicken ravioli in the lunch area. Other items on the menu included french toast, fresh fruit, bagels and breakfast breads, cereal, a full salad bar, prime rib, and several assorted sauteed vegetable trays. My date had the bread pudding for dessert, which she said was great (I opted for the cheesecake, also good).\n\nThere were two downsides:\n- We had a 10:30 reservation, so we showed up at 10:24, there were a few people inside eating. We were told by the hostess that they weren't open until 10, but we were welcome to sit in the bar area.  A few minutes later she called us in and sat us. A waitress came out to take our drink order, and then we got food. The thing is, some of the items were already cold. An example: the homestyle potatoes were rock solid. It turns out that there was a private reunion breakfast there that morning, and the people we saw were the stragglers, but the food had been sitting out for hours (I was told that 10:30 was the earliest reservation, so we went thinking everything would be fresh).\n- The waitress wasn't very good. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, only our table and 3-4 others, but she seemed to struggle keeping drink orders straight and keeping plates cleared. Would have liked at least one other.\n\nOverall, based on this, and my previous visits there, I would recommend the restaurant, and will go there again when I am in town next.", 'business_id': 'u1wF70zlIMVOG9sPvwyojA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-03-19', 'type': 'review'}

It's a friendly place to take the kids even and it won't break the bank if you watch what you choose.  I wouldn't go downstairs though unless you want the typical college bar experience.  Upstairs is a nice, if crowded sit down place with mirrors on both walls that make it look bigger. \n\nTheir chef/s do a good job and their pasta is good.  Some entrees are from frozen ingredients though and you can tell if you know what to look for but they still taste good.  Their pita pizza is some of the best pizza in the NRV and I've had a lot around the area.\n\nThe beer selection is top of the line both on-tap and in bottles.  I don't really know about the rest of their drink selection as I haven't had it for over a decade.  Happy hour is at a nice price point and their dollar bottled beer special has never steered me wrong.  You can't be cheaper than that for beer.\n\nThe noise can get high at times due to the crowds, sometimes the live band, and the reverberant walls/mirrors but it's never gotten deafening or hurtful.\n\nThe wait staff can be slow; they have to take care of two floors of people - the bar downstairs and the more normal restaurant upstairs.  I feel the cooks are likely responsible for some of the delays too for similar reasons.  But I've only had to ask them to hurry up once.  They haven't been slow all the time either.  My suggestion is to arrive early, about 5 or 5:30 and it will speed things up.  Also, Fridays and Saturdays are slower IMO.\n\nIf you watch what you order you can get by for about $45 for two kids and two adults including tip.  That's with beer.  Of course, if you order dessert or buy more expensive entrees it can go over $50.  If everyone gets pita pizza and water it will be less.

The atmosphere is ecclectic or tacky, depending on how you view things.  The ceilings are low and they have installed walls/booths, which make the dining areas very cozy and quiet.\n\nWe started in the bar, which was somewhat unremarkable.  Service was very prompt and cheery and prices were very reasonable.  Expect a handful of tables and a couple of TV's.  The bartender said that the prime rib was the best ever.\n\nWe were seated in a cozy booth, which may have been a little tricky to get into if you were bigger or maybe a little arthritic.  It had the red vinyl benches noted in other reviews.  The lighting isn't bright by any means and was placed low enough to be irritating.  I kept seeing bulbs as I looked down at my meal.\n\nWhen somebody brags about having the best prime rib, you need to take them up on it.  For about $30, I received a meaty, sizeable cut of prime rib, baked potato, and side salad.  The salad was again, unremarkable, and the potato and bread were just fine.  My prime rib was very pink, so much so that it looked almost uncooked to the naked eye.  I sent it back and it quickly returned a little more done, but certainly not medium rare.  I'd rate it OK overall.  The cut had the typical fatty band around a somewhat well marbled center.  It was very slow roasted, so it was very tender, but lacked any interesting or unique flavor.  If you want the best prime rib at any price, I can unconditionally recommend the New London Steakhouse near Lynchburg, which won rave reviews by some veteran business travelers and food/wine snobs.  Overall, was very prompt and courteous.\n\nI would say that the Farmhouse is an OK restaurant, but definitely overpriced.  The waitstaff wears tuxedo shirts - but the table mats are same printed paper style found at any chain restaurant.  Prices are comparable to better chains, but quality is less than I would have expected.  The menu is also what one would expect, offering several standards with one or two quasi-unique offerings.  Certainly the ambiance doesn't warrant the extra price, so I'm struggling to find the value here.  It's not bad - it's just not good enough at one thing (quality/variety/environment) to make me want to go back.  Four business travelers racked up $180 with tips, which includes a modest compliment of drinks.\n\nBeware - if you can't wait in the bar, there doesn't appear to be much of a waiting area.\n\nIn closing, the Farmhouse won't be the best or the worst meal you ever had and presents a questionable bang for the buck.

"Slow smoked sirloin" with grilled zucchini and garlic mashed potatoes. Sounds delicious right? Well, not really. The plate came with 6 unevenly cut slices of zucchini that had been steamed and then slapped on the grill for char-marks. The garlic mash was indeed garlic-laden, however had the consistency of lumpy glue. I ordered by steak medium rare but it came out well done and pre-sliced. I hate when they slice my steak for me, but that\'s not the point. The "smoked" flavor was atrocious. It was like they made a fire with plastic and then threw the steak on for a few hours. The only way I got the thing down was to cover up the "smoke" flavor with their vinegar based spicy barbeque sauce. \n\nMy friend got the pulled pork plate. That\'s a dish that is always on the menu so you think they would have perfected it. Again, no. The "roasted vegetables" it came with were still swimming in the water they used to boil them. The baked beans on the plate tasted like it came out of a can...actually the canned stuff is better than what was on his plate. The pork was just "meh". He also poured the mustard-spicy sauce on it and that made the whole thing taste considerably better. \n\nThe only great thing I\'ve ever had here were the smoked wings. They come in a ton of flavors and taste great going down with a cold beer.

Carrots undercooked but too long in dry, hot conditions leaving them quite caramelized in a very sweet and spiced sauce.  So, aside from the slightly tough texture I liked them though were too tough, sweet and a bit over spiced for some I suspect.  I had the stuffed chicken this second time and it was good but not great.  Like the carrots, a bit overcooked I suspect with respect to the meat.\n\nMy wife loved the food.  I preferred the shepherd's pie I had last time.  Last time I liked the soda bread but this time it was not as sweet and rather bland.  The beer was good but expensive.  I can get just as good in the Cellar if not better, with a better selection overall by far.  If you really want better draught, go to the London Underground.\n\nGotta say, I was disappointed this time.  Even with a lack of crowds, parking was difficult (not their fault), service was slow and the food just okay.  However, I feel the management cares and IS trying to improve things (it's their shirts after all) for the better.  I hope they can get better food.  To do what they want they need to get a cook the quality of Mickey G's in Floyd only with Irish food.\n\nWRT parking, they are in a bind.  Local businesses are dead set against this restaurant.  You can park across the street at Blacksburg Auto Parts or the old Exxon after their stores close so that helps.  Perhaps Blacksburg should consider making it a responsibility of all businesses to allow free parking after they close in this area of town?\n\nPrice is too high, in my estimation, with too long a wait to have such rather slightly above average (at best) food.\n\nThe wait is too long and yet I know they have an upstairs room that wasn't being used this day.

There weren't a lot of people there when we stopped in on Thursday night, and we had no problems with slow service as some of the other reviewers have mentioned.\n\nWe started with the cheese board which was quite large for the price, with 3 kinds of cheese, grapes, walnuts, dried apricots. baguette slices and balsamic honey. The balsamic honey sounded very interesting, but just tasted like honey.  There was quite a large bowl of it on the plate, I'm not sure why...?\n\nWe followed that with one of the selections from the special menu, a sauteed calamari and shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce over a lemon risotto with prosciutto cracklings and the crab cakes. The crab cakes were good, but we were a little disappointed that the black bean puree they were served on was cold (like icy cold) and the mashed potatoes that came with them, while very tasty, were cold as well. The shrimp and calamari dish was fabulous though! \n\nWe took a peek in the wine bar on the way out and it looked really cozy with white leather couches and a beautiful bar.

You cant judge a book by its cover though because I have stepped foot into some smaller restaurants that put out some great tasting food. What this place lacks on the inside it replaces with putting out some of the best pitas I have ever eaten. \nI ordered the Souvlaki Pita which comes with pork tenderloin marinated in some sweet spices (not hot), cucumber sauce, lite lettuce and cubed tomatoes. My partner had the combo which is pork mixed with lamb along with the same condiments as mine. The pitas are served with two sheets of wax paper holding it together like a burrito. Don't expect anything fancy like silverware or plates for this meal. I laid out the waxed papers and went to town. The marinated meat with the cucumber sauce meshed so well together that I was so tempted to purchase another. Total cost of the meal is under 6bucks minus drink.

It was an interesting night to say the least. It was our first time dining at the restaurant and our waitress was in training. \n\nThough the service wasn't bad at all, I think that it definitely could have been better. I know she was new so we cut her some slack, but I just feel like the other waiters and waitresses at our surrounding tables were more on top of things and checked on their diners way more than she came to check on us. Again, I don't blame her because she's new so we let it slide. \n\nAfter we ordered our drinks, we got a loaf of bread with garlic dipping sauce that was really good. My one gripe about the bread was that every table had the choice between an Italian or Olive loaf and we didn't. The waitress didn't ask us what we wanted and just brought us a loaf of white bread. I would have preferred the Olive loaf... but again, we let it slide.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Spinach and cheese raviloi in their Mushroom Rose sauce which was AMAZING! The sauce was really really good - I enjoyed it a lot. \n\nMy fiance ordered the lasagna which looked incredibly overcooked and didn't really taste all that special. I had a bite of his and it really tasted like what I make at home. Typically, when you go out, you expect your entrees to taste better than something you can throw together at home so that was a huge letdown. He didn't eat the bottom piece of pasta on his lasagna because it was stuck to the baking dish and burnt pretty badly. I think he would have liked it a lot better if he got a different entree.\n\nAll in all, it was an okay experience. It wasn't the best Italian we've ever had, but it wasn't bad either. I thought the entrees were a touch over price for what they were. I mean this isn't exactly fine dining or anything even though I think they try to come off as a fine dining establishment... \n\nGiven the choice, I'm not sure if I'd come back or not. I think just because it was our first time and we got a new waitress, things just weren't as great as they could have been.

My suggestions would be: the tofu pad thai (pretty standard pad thai with tofu, they're pretty skimpy on the tofu but the flavors of the pad thai make up for it), the ruby curry with tofu (again skimpy with the tofu, but to stretch the meal out just order 1 order of the curry and take it home and make several cups of rice and eat forever) I say come here for lunch and save yourself a couple of bucks.\n\nRough estimate spent on a date(dinner):\n-$6 for 2 thai teas (sweetened black tea with half and half)\n-$11 for 1 order of tofu ruby curry (comes with rice)\n-$11 for 1 order of tofu pad thai \n-$3 for tip\n\n=$31 mehhhhh", 'business_id': 'F_ofTZiczPkYZ93JAE3RRQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-10-18', 'type': 'review'}

Ironically, it is located in an old, rather unattractive strip mall. They also distribute bread to markets and restaurants around the region, including selling their loaves at the Roanoke Natural Foods Co-Op. Nicole and I had stopped in once before just to see the inside of the restaurant and we sampled some slices of bread, but didn\'t end up ordering anything. This time, I planned ahead and was looking forward to finding something good for lunch. \n\nSadly, the main word I\'d take away from my experience would be "disappointing." While trying to figure out what to order for lunch, the entire set up was rather confusing. I was unable to find a menu and couldn\'t figure out where I was supposed to place my order. I eventually made my way over to the cash register and ordered and then was told that my food would be right out. As I was waiting at the counter for my food, another staff person asked me if I needed anything and I mentioned that I hadn\'t received my food. She proceeded to get my sandwich for me but I still felt like this was a very unorganized process. Once I started eating, the disappointment continued. I ordered the special for the day - a sandwich with turkey, provolone, pesto, tomato, & peppers on sourdough bread, and the sandwich was good. It was toasted and a little oily from the pesto but had good flavor and crunch. However, it was served with a side of a sort of avocado fruit salad. The flavors in this side are something I would normally like, but it was served hot and I considered it to be inedible. Again, the continued theme of me sitting there thinking, "What are they doing?"\n\nIn all, I was hoping for a lot more from Our Daily Bread. For $8.00 for my sandwich and side, it isn\'t something I\'d be interested in returning for again. And I hope I was just there on an off day for the service and flow of ordering because that seemed to be an unnecessary frustration.

I have to say that my experience there was a great one. I originally moved to Blacksburg due to a relocation with the military. My office was on the campus of Virginia Tech, so I wanted to live somewhere that was close by. Windsor Hills is just that, being a short two miles from where I needed to be. The second necessity for me was that it needed to be pet friendly, which it is. I found this to be a difficult feature to find, as the vast majority of the locations around Blacksburg are NOT pet friendly. This might be to shut out "irresponsible" college kids and their animals. As a result, though, it seems about 80% or more of Windsor Hills residents have a pet (mostly dogs). My two major concerns fulfilled, I\'ll discuss a few of their pros and cons.\n\nPRO:\n\n* Pet Friendly. Not only pet friendly, but caters to pet owners. There are numerous pet waste stations where they provide waste bags and places to dispose of the poop. There\'s a small dog park on the property where you can let your dog run free. They also host Yappy Hours on the hillside where people let their dogs run and play together, while also providing water and treats. Also, during the summer, they\'ll sometimes host pool parties where all the dogs get to jump in the pool and play with each other. Despite the amount of dogs that live in the complex, I\'ve never been bothered by barking dogs and never have had to worry about dog poop everywhere. All of us were owners in the same community, so there was much respect and responsibility!\n\n* Hosted Events. They often hosted events in the clubhouse where there were themed parties, or just free food offered. This wasn\'t once a quarter or once a month; it was more like several times a week. Examples are where they\'d provide free donuts from 8-11am from a great local donut shop, or during lunchtimes they\'d provide all the fixings for you to come and make your own sandwiches. Great benefit for "starving students". \n\n* Pool and Gym. Their gym wasn\'t an LA Fitness, but it was pretty good for an apartment complex. They have a few treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. The weight room is better, though. It actually has a decent selection of free weight and cable machines. Definitely enough for a good lift. Afterwards, take a dip in the outdoor pool. I don\'t think it was heated in any way, because it was always cold, but this wasn\'t too bad during Virginia summers when its 90 degrees out. \n\n* Tenants. I never had any issues with any of my neighbors. This, actually, was a great surprise to me. I\'m not old, but at 31, I\'m older than all the kids in college. My neighbors, however, weren\'t 18 and 19 year olds. The audience at Windsor Hills was primarily graduate students, a few teachers, or people like me that didn\'t attend school but were somehow connected. There were a few undergraduate students in my building, but mostly seniors. Regardless of age or situation, not once did I experience loud parties, drunk people stumbling back at night, or any other disruption. Even at the height of football season, I never saw any rambunctious behavior. Shocking!\n\nCON:\n\n* Parking. Honestly, coming from Seattle, I didn\'t find the parking that bad. But I can see how some would get annoyed at times. During the summer, or on Friday nights, parking is wiiiide open. But during the school year, it can get full after about 6pm. My building wasn\'t so bad due to its location, but down the way, I could see that people sometimes struggled to find parking out front.\n\n* Laundry Machines. This is a semi-con that could easily be a pro all the way. Each building has one to two washers and dryers in the basement. Very convenient versus going to a central location or a laundromat. My issue is that they\'re all coin operated and there\'s no on-site change machine. I once lived at a place that had machines that read cards that you could load money onto. Or, like a laundromat, they could have change machines. But everyone had their own solution. I would go to an actual laundromat and get a few handfuls of quarters. Others would go to a bank and get rolls of quarters. Not a major hiccup, but kind of annoying when you want to do laundry and then realize you don\'t have a dozen quarters on hand.\n\nThose are about the only two cons, and they\'re stretching it. It was a real joy living here during my stay in Blacksburg. To wrap it up, I have to say my end was nice as well. Easy staff to deal with and I got all of my deposit back. Not bad for living in an apartment for two years with a 85lb dog. Kudos for Windsor Hills.

It is hands down one of the best restaurants in Blacksburg. I have probably gone here the most throughout my whole undergrad career, and when I come back to visit my friends and boyfriend I always have stop by! Everything is always fresh, so don\'t get mad if their menu changes or they run out of something - that\'s when you know they\'re the real deal! \n\nIf you want to get drinks, I\'d suggest their mojitos (again, my favorite) or their silver surfer margarita (classic margarita taste, but they never get it wrong)! They also have a full bar with a large selection of beers, but I don\'t drink beer usually so I can\'t really give any advice on that! \n\nTo start, their complementary fresh chips and corn/tomato salsa are delicious. Every time I go my waiter/waitress has had to refill at LEAST once :P If you\'re looking for another appetizer, the spinach-artichoke dip is incredible! They serve it with fried pita wedges, which are amazing. \n\nNow to get to the main stars, the tacos! Definitely do not miss out on trying the soy ginger shrimp tacos. Like I\'ve said in other reviews, shrimp\'s not my favorite, but these are lightly fried in a delicious batter and then glazed with the soy ginger sauce. This combination with the fresh cabbage is just happiness in your mouth. The BBQ Mahi tacos are also something you should not miss out on trying! Since I\'ve eaten here so much, I\'ve tried all the tacos and these two are the best. My most recent favorite were the soft shell crab tacos, but it was a special just for that day and the next time I came back they weren\'t serving them! Sad day. \n\nIf you\'re looking for advice on their sides, the jalapeno cheddar mashers, black beans and rice, and the baja rice are the best ones. However, they have most recently changed the recipe for the jalapeno cheddar mashers and I do not love them as much as I did before. They now dice up pickled jalapeno and add them to what are now just called "herb mashers" if you want jalapeno. Definitely changes the flavor and isn\'t as good as it used to be.

Don\'t be fooled, there are some poor choices on the menu like the pollo mexicano, but overall, the best in (or near) town. Also, the jumbo margs are a little sweet, but you can order the Texas marg and share with a friend and still need to call a DD. Also, imports are cheap and domestics are expensive comparatively - so that\'s a nice flip-flop.\n\nThe family that runs the place is always kind and if you come enough they start to recognize you and know what you\'d like to drink.

Typically, this is not a good thing as restaurants that offer different ethnic cuisines (Chinese, Japanese, Thai and a little Korean in China Inn's case) rarely ever do any of them even remotely well. BUT this is a welcome addition to the restaurants in Blacksburg since there's little variety in dining compared to other, more busy college towns.\n\nI ordered delivery from them today, and got the shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer, the teriyaki chicken, and the pan-fried gyoza. Everything was decent and tasted fine. The tempura and gyoza was soggy but this had probably a lot to do with the fact it was delivery. The chicken teriyaki tasted all right, if a little dry. But it had a teriyaki flavor to it, and it was completely edible and even a little enjoyable- I liked the abundance of onions and broccoli that gave the dish a little more of a kick.\n\nStill, my standards for Blacksburg restaurants is that if it's not bland, if it at least tries to approximate the basic flavors of the cuisine they're trying to mimic (Boudreaux's for cajun fare has failed at this many, many times), I'm happy. Do I still miss restaurants back home in California? Yup. Can I survive here if I have a place like China Inn to order delivery from? Sure. And as sad as that is, that's all that matters to me right now, and that's a 4 star review, curved for Blacksburg standards.", 'business_id': 'T6eavqkeaIrv4giuCeXTPw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-06-15', 'type': 'review'}

Bull and Bones had a lot of potential and fell short in almost all categories both times I have been there.\n\nMOOD: Brewery restaurant feel with the stills, large bar, tall tables and the restaurant half. Both times I have been to the bar areas, as they have a much better wall of TVs that is actually very decent for watching sport events. For this purpose, this may be the best place in Blacksburg to watch games while having a drink and munchies.\n\nSERVICE: Hit or miss. The first time I came was the first week the restaurant opened and my service was terrible enough that I could have gotten a free meal easily (I ordered an appetizer and it took over an hour to get it, to a point that I didn't want it anymore). The second time things were a bit more timely, so I won't hold them being new against them too much. On to what matters:\n\nBEER: They have a regular selection and a seasonal. Many of the regulars taste very similar to each other, I was hoping more experimentation with styles and a stronger selection. Indeed, any of their beers beats the american macros you can get anywhere, but they aren't quite better than something as simple as a guinness or sam adams draft. The stout is quite good, but it isn't very drinkable with food. I suppose the lunch pale ale would be my most balanced choice, but I would prefer Rock Bottom's beer selections. \n\nThe worst part about it is that their happy hour is basically nonexistent. They say they have one, but I haven't seen it yet. The advantage of having a brewery/restaurant is that you can discount your beer, however I haven't paid less than 4.50 for a pint where at Rock Bottom I could get 1.50 pints and cheaper food during the happy hour.  \n\nFOOD: It's pretty standard. I didn't find anything on the menu that stands out at me and makes my mouth water and want to order it, the appetizers were just OK and my burger was overcooked. Also, again I must complain about the lack of a decent happy hour really killing this place for me. \n\nAll in all, if you want to watch sports you can go here or to buffalo wild wings. They have better beer, but it's not worth the extra $$ they charge for it. I won't consider going unless they have 2 dollar pints and cheap nachos, it just doesn't taste good enough to justify spending more at this place.", 'business_id': 'KsrMCDF689P4bTBrrbTLjA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2009-08-07', 'type': 'review'}

It's a huge step above other places in town if you're in the mood for tacos and 'ritas.  \n\nThe food here is amazing.  It tastes fresh and natural, and isn't weighed down with grease and cheese.  My husband and I each ordered an order of tacos (the beer battered white fish and the lemon grilled shrimp), and split them.  I had previously had the garlic buffalo shrimp, and loved them, but wanted to branch out and try something new since I don't get to visit that often.  All of the food I've had here has been delicious.  I enjoy that you can choose a side and they are different than the typical rice and beans.  The 'ritas here are also highly recommended.  There are many to choose from, but the restaurant doesn't use pre-made bottled margarita mix, it is their own recipe made in house, so they are much more flavorful than what you might typically get at a restaurant.  \n\nThe reason this restaurant loses one star is due to the service.  We went at dinner time on a Football weekend Saturday, so I expected there to be a wait.  The restaurant does not allow you to call ahead to have your name placed on the list, but if you show up in person to be put on the list they will call your phone when your table is ready, so during the hour+ wait we were able to go to a nearby bar and have a few drinks while we waited for the call.  When we hadn't heard back in an hour, one of the members of our party walked back, and they told her it would be another 20 minutes.  Within 5 minutes of that, they called her and said she had 2 minutes to get back to the restaurant.  When we arrived, we were told our table wasn't ready, and were asked to wait upstairs.  I'm not sure if perhaps two different hosts had been dealing with her, but it was annoying to be told we had 20 minutes, then told we had only 2 or we would lose our table, only to show up and have to wait even longer.  They also had quite a number of tables in the upstairs area that were empty where the supposedly serve appetizers only.  I didn't quite understand why a restaurant would have an hour wait and not be utilizing all of it's available space, which was frustrating.  Once we were finally seated the service was fine, and we had an enjoyable meal.  In the future I will go put my name on the list an hour before I'd like to eat, or I will wait and enjoy Cabo on Sunday before I leave town when perhaps the wait isn't as bad.", 'business_id': 'aURgpKldq6YKqAleHaFUtA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-10-15', 'type': 'review'}

Don\'t let its location fool you. A completely full service bakery, ranging from wedding cakes and other special event cakes (great place to get a graduation cake I\'m sure), to almond croissants and fresh baked bread. They also have lots of deals going on towards the end of the day to get discounts on pastries (such as buy 2 get one free). My favorite pastry is the almond croissant.\n\nODB has a very large space, with a full service breakfast and lunch area on the other side of the bakery. Quiches, ratatouille, fruit salads, and sandwiches galore for lunch... with outdoor seating as well as plenty of seating inside. It is a bit outside of the main "downtown" area of Blacksburg, but is still in a pretty convenient location. \n\nThe regular crowd seems to be on the adult and elderly side... but I think it is a great alternative for students to try something new for lunch, and especially a perfect place to go with visiting parents ( and an opportunity to support a local business rather than go somewhere such as a chain like Panera). \n\nOne aspect I do not like about the staff is that they are too quick to ask you what you\'d like. There is so much to take in at this bakery, and I want to be able to look at the whole range of pastries and goodies, before finally making a selection. That could be just me though, I guess fast service is probably one of their priorities... but I wouldn\'t mind a slower pace in there.\n\nODB also offers samples daily... but it seems that its not actually encouraged for people to participate in the sampling... and barely any time to take in what you sampled before being asked what you\'d like. \n\nI would like to see ODB open a smaller location in the downtown area of Blacksburg, so that students and visiting families could stop in and have a bite to eat, without having to drive to their actual location down South Main.\n\ncheck out their website for lots more details about pastries and other goodies... they also seem to update it pretty regularly with lunch and breakfast specials.\n\nhttp://www.odbb.com/', 'business_id': 'I5dFvzPt57bb9T7z0Mp-jw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-06-12', 'type': 'review'}

Their food is good - decent jambalaya and killer seafood gumbo. Upstairs patio seating on plastic chairs in the summer and warmer months. Cool atmosphere most of the time, but now it\'s time to explain my review. \n\nI have been bared from returning to this restaurant. Here\'s the story: my girlfriend and I came in for dinner on a late Monday night. We sat at a small enclosed table and waited a while for the bar tender to come over (where she had customers) and take our drink orders. She explained that the server had just been cut so she would be taking care of us. Drinks took forever to get back and she was not at all friendly. It was very clear that we were a nuisance to her. Food took even longer than the drinks did - we had chicken and salmon. When the food did come, salmon was well undercooked. The bartender took it back and 5 minutes later came back okay. We were the only people dining now with a few at the bar. Only after waiting nearly 15 minutes after we had finished our meals did the bartender come by and collect the plates. Another 10 for the credit cards to be collected. Then she ran the same credit card twice. Needlessly to say I asked for the manager who asked me to get up and go to the bar to meet him. I explained how we were very unhappy we were and how we would like to not pay for such a horrible experience. Instead of being understanding, the manager explained that we could stiff on the service, but we still needed to pay for the food. After arguing some more, he threatened to call the police for us not paying. After realizing we really would not pay, he said "Fine. Don\'t pay if you promise to never come back here." Trust me, no problem. \n\nDo not waste your time here. While the food may be decent, such disregard for customers and lack of concern for their dining experience should not be tolerated. There are plenty of other places to eat in Blacksburg that this place.', 'business_id': 'Te72-fjbquQFCfPBgJ4ldQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2008-05-23', 'type': 'review'}

It\'s a very cool place, and their music selection is good as well.\n\nThe first time I went, my server was incredibly attentive - after noticing we were still looking at the menu, he didn\'t ask if we were ready, but rather waited until we closed up the menus and looked ready to order.  He refilled our waters without us calling for him, and even brought along takeout boxes with our receipt.  When he came back with the receipt again, he brought a bag for our takeout boxes.  All without us asking!\nThe second time, the service was good, but definitely not as good.  \n\nThe beauty of this place is the size of its menu - it serves mostly sandwiches, but there is pasta and other choices as well if you\'re really interested.  The first time I ordered the Titanic sandwich, and the second time I made my own sandwich.  Both times, the bread was soft (even with the French bread, which is usually crunchy and hurts my teeth with its goodness) but crunchy, the meat generously given, and the cheese melted to perfection.  Yum!  If you order their sandwiches, they come with a side, and if you make your own sandwich, they come with chips.  \nThe servings are more than generous - only half of the sandwich feels like a meal in itself.  Both times I\'ve been there, I saved half my sandwich after being full, and had a very good dinner that night!\n\nI also ordered an appetizer to share with my friends - we chose the spinach-archichoke dip with pita bread, which was really good.  Spindip is usually my appetizer of choice to "assess" a place, and this one was very good.  The bread to dip ratio was perfect both times, and the dip itself was very good - not too cheesy, or purely spinach.  I\'ll try to give more appetizers more tries my next time here!\n\nThis is definitely a nice place for a college town - check out the discounts for the day (they have one for every day).

My wife's prime rib looked bigger than the claimed 10oz cut, and came with easily double the amount of mash potatoes that my plate had. The meat was moist and had been seasoned with an interesting spice blend. We finished off the meal with a slice of blackout cake.

I\'ve seen midnight screening, gotten free sneak previews, see "The Price is Right", and that\'s just what I have see.

They have live music there during the week. They have a little area called the "Champagne Room" that\'s a bit more private, if you can manage to get it. Downstairs is the tavern area, where people go to have drinks and food in a more adult and casual setting. I usually go downstairs at night and upstairs during the day. They card in the tavern area later on during the night. They have a big TV downstairs where they play sports. The once smokey atmosphere is now gone as well, which is very nice.\n\nBeer and specials - They have a long list of beers to choose from and a recently opened section where they sell local microbrews. I have yet to check it out but I\'ve heard good things.\nWeekdays 6-7pm is Hammertime where you get half off beers, on Sundays they have deals on imported beers. You can also do the "Luck of the Draw" where you pay a dollar for a random beer of their choosing. I\'ve usually gotten stuff on the lower end of things, but its pretty fun to do and it\'s only a buck!\n\nDrinks - Their drinks are always good, not watered down and weak like in most places downtown. Definitely worth going for drinks alone.\n\nFood - Always great. I usually get the pita pizza which is a create your own pizza (you choose 3 ingredients) and is an awesome buy for around 5 bucks. They totally fill you up or make for yummy leftovers. I\'ve also tried their sandwiches and subs, always come out good and fill you up. Their appetizers are also delicious - the hummus, spinach and artichoke dips, and their spanakopita\'s are great.\n\nService - The one thing they\'re not great at is service, although they have greatly improved since I started going there. You can expect to wait a bit, especially if you\'re downstairs. You can also take it upon yourself to head to the bar and order if you\'re feeling antsy and want your stuff sooner. Upstairs they tend to come around more often.\n\nBottom line - Definitely check them out if you\'re in the \'burg - it would be a sin not to!', 'business_id': '76hIZMzHZ_lFM0p2N7_gRQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-04-05', 'type': 'review'}

Once you walk in you notice all of the crazy artwork on the ceiling tiles of the entire restaurant, many of them designed by local students and artists.  The menu has many of your traditional Lebanese/Mediterranean staples like Falafel, baba ghanoush, gyros, etc, as well as calzones and pizzas and hot-submarine sandwiches.  I felt since this place was known for their Mediterranean food I'd go for that, asked the waiter what in his opinion was the best on the menu and he recommended their 'mixed-grill' platter.\n\nThis included:\n-2 skewers of mixed seasoned chicken and steak and various veggies\n-a pita the size of a barstool seat (im not kidding)\n-a good size pile of hummus with olive oil and paprika\n-a salad made with romaine\n\nThe meat was extremely well seasoned and juicy, the pita was fresh from the oven and hot, the hummus was tangy and went well with everything, and the salad was made with romaine as opposed to worthless iceberg.\n\nAll of this was $9.95!!  I can't stress enough that this is THE BEST value in Blacksburg in my opinion.  \n\nBottom Line: This place has your standard Mediterranean/Lebanese fair and knows how to do it well.  The service is a little slow, but is totally worth the wait when your food comes.  The value of the meal I ordered is unbeatable, I cannot vouch for the rest of the menu.

This calzone is more like a family-sized chicken pot pie. \n\nIn some ways, it is almost too big.  I know the disappointment of not finishing is countered by the jubilation of left-overs for lunch the next day.  However, this foot-ball sized Italian beast is so huge, that the crust to filling ratio is a little off.  I love cheese, but it\'s tough for me to eat a pound or two of it without plenty of bread.\n\nOtherwise, the calzone is very tasty.  The crust is AWESOME.  Crispy, crunchy, soft, and flavorful.\n\nI think one of things I like most about the Cellar is the seating in the basement/"Cellar."

If you come early enough, they might still have some of their delicious scratch-made biscuits left for you (they run out quickly)! Their potatoes that come with any of "Our Old Favorites" choices are also great, and if you decide to go for an omelet, don\'t worry - they don\'t skimp out on the fillings you choose! My boyfriend recently had their Tofu Scramble as well and he loved it. While you\'re paying your bill at the register, don\'t forget to snag some of the freshly-baked desserts at the counter baked from Bollos Cafe down the street! \n\nI\'ve been a loyal Gillies fan for the past 5 years and haven\'t been disappointed.

The Firehouse brand had made a good impression on me with their subs and then their pizza adverts.

That's just weird to me. \n\nSecondly, I was being charged $18 for a large specialty and 2 marinara. The guy taking my order was very kind though and corrected his error when I pointed out that my large specialty should only be 10.99 + 1.00 for the marinara. He quickly corrected it to 12.04. I'm not sure how the math works there but I'm pretty sure it's wrong. Anyway, from the few reviews here, it does seem like the whole pricing+ coupons thing desperately needs to be paid some attention.\n\nAnd finally...the pizza...I could have overlooked the aforementioned circumstance as my food was in fact delivered promptly and the service was courteous. However, I ordered the Firehouse Pizza and it was pretty subpar. The crust was tough and bland and the sauce wasn't flavorful at all.
